- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Ahmed. 
I am a data analysis specialist at Udacity who loves dealing with programming languages and codes, so I implemented Python and MySQL. 
I have recently worked on a project to analyze the TMDB movie dataset to help them focus on how certain factors could affect both the revenues and budgets. 
Right now, I am working to implement Machine Learning in my work, so I could even help more companies.

Skills: Python (with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib Modules), MySQL, and spreadsheets
